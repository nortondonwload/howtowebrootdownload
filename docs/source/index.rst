🛒 Webroot via Best Buy or Geek Squad – How It Works
----------------------------------------------------

When you purchase Webroot SecureAnywhere through Best Buy or Geek Squad, your subscription is typically tied to your Best Buy account or Geek Squad membership, not just a physical product. You get access to:

- Full version of Webroot SecureAnywhere
- Automatic renewals (if enabled)
- Multi-device protection (depending on your plan)
- Geek Squad support (in many cases)

Before installing, you’ll need two things:

- Your Webroot Keycode
- The Webroot installer (downloadable)

🔍 Step 1: Locate Your Webroot Keycode
--------------------------------------

Your keycode is a 20-character alphanumeric code (e.g., SA69-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA-AAAA). You’ll need this to activate Webroot Premium features.

Here’s where to find it:

**If You Purchased In-Store or Online from Best Buy:**

- Check your purchase receipt or confirmation email.
- Log in to your Best Buy account:
  👉 https://www.bestbuy.com
- Navigate to “Digital Library” under your profile to find Webroot info.
- Or go to the Geek Squad portal at:
  👉 https://www.webroot.com/En_US/bestbuy

If you still can't find your keycode, contact Geek Squad support or visit your local Best Buy for help.

1. Open Webroot.
2. Click the gear icon next to **My Account**.
3. Enter your keycode and click **Activate**.

Your product will now be fully activated and linked to your subscription.
